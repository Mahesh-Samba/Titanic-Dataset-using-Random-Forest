# Titanic-Dataset-using-Random-Forest

In this project, I performed a comprehensive machine learning analysis on the titanic dataset. 
The analysis included exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations like heat maps, count plots, and pair plots to understand data distribution and relationships. 
Feature engineering was performed to handle missing values and convert categorical variables to numerical. 
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier was done using GridSearchCV. 
The best model was trained and evaluated, with results visualized using a confusion matrix.
